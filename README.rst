Baseline
--------

There are -more or less- official `conventions <http://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/topics/development/conventions/formulas.html>`_ and
`best practices <http://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/topics/best_practices.html>` described in the SaltStack documentation. However in my
humble opinion (IMHO) some of those suggestions and convention rules are, based on my long-time experiences with Salt, not suitable for practical use.

This document describes my deviations that have proven to be useful for me. Everyone is invited to discuss about it.

Most of formulas at https://github.com/search?q=user%3Abechtoldt+-formula are created based on the guidelines of this document.
